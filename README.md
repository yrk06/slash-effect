# slash-effect
slash effect project demo in godot
this was made possible after studying the Alex Vlachos GDC 2010 presentation power point, available at: http://bit.ly/ValveL4D2

# About the Effect
the effect is based entirely on the shader hiding parts of the mesh and displaying a blood effect around it.
It is suited for games with many diferent types of enemies that share the same body (for instance L4D2 many zombie types)

Advantages comes from simplicity, this effect does not create any extra complex geometry.
On the other side, due to godot Array limitations inside the Shader language, is not possible to have more than 1 slash on the same mesh

# About the code
